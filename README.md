## Overview

The LOLCODE Interpreter is a JavaFX application written in Java. It allows you to interpret and execute LOLCODE programs.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Amazon Corretto version 11.0.9
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any other Java IDE of your choice)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lolcode-interpreter.git
2. **Open the Project in IntelliJ:**

Open IntelliJ IDEA.
Click on "Open" and select the cloned project directory.
Build the Project:

Wait for IntelliJ to index and build the project.
Run the Application:

Navigate to the source code/main/java/octavo.cmsc124.lolcode_program directory.
Find the Main class (LolCodeMain.java) and right-click on it.
Select "Run LolCodeMain".

Use the LOLCODE Interpreter:

Once the application is running, you can enter LOLCODE programs in the provided interface.
Click on the "Execute" button to execute the LOLCODE program.

The output pane will display the output of the program. The lexeme table shows the tokenized code of the program. And the symbol table shows the value of the variables that aid the semantics of the program.

## Notes
The LOLCODE Interpreter uses JavaFX, so ensure that your Java environment and IDE support JavaFX.
Maven is used for dependency management. If you're using IntelliJ, it should automatically download the required dependencies.
